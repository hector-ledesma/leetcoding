# Leetcode attempts and writings

I don't always find a solution (within my time limit), but I aim to _always_ learn something on every question attempt.

I often write notes to analyze my mistakes and successes to derive insight and improve.

| Difficulty | Time Limit | Goal |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Easy       | 15 Minutes | I like to use easy challenges as "reps" for exposing myself to a language's syntax and building muscle memory. |
| Medium     | 30 Minutes | The meat of interview-prep. I mostly aim to recognize common patterns, and complete as many as possible. |
| Hard       | 1 Hour     | For hard challenges, I avoid looking for patterns. My aim is to improve my logical problem-solving skills. |
